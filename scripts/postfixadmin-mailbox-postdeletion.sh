# Script for removing a mailbox dir in ecloud

# The script looks at arguments 1 and 2, assuming that they 
# indicate username and domain, respectively.


# the script is actually run by the pfexec user
# the script handles deletion in a bind-mounted dir shared with mailserver
# so pfexec user has no right over it. it needs a specific sudo perm 
#to be able to only run this script
# the /etc/sudoers line added to the container during install :
# pfexec ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/postfixadmin-mailbox-postdeletion.sh
# The line states that the pfexec user may run the script without providing a password.


# where the mailbox dirs are bind-mounted on the container.
basedir=/var/mail/vhosts

    # double check both arguments are provided
